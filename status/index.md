title: "JSON API: Specification Status"
---

**This document is a work in progress** and will change as implementation work
progresses. Implementors should be aware that this specification is not stable.
It is currently missing some details about the `meta` attribute and could be
more precise about details of working with relationships.

Work on this specification is being done at its [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/json-api/json-api). Please feel free to help
flesh it out or, if you try to write an implementation, to tell us where things
were ambiguous. The best way to do so is to [file an
Issue](https://github.com/json-api/json-api/issues).
